### Backend Setup

The backend API server (**lexi-Authen**) handles authentication, role management, permissions, and other essential services. Follow the steps below to set up and run the backend server.

#### Setting Up SSH for GitHub

To clone the repository using SSH, you need to configure SSH access to GitHub. Follow the steps below tailored for both macOS and Windows users.

##### macOS/Linux

1. **Check for Existing SSH Keys**

   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```

   Look for files like `id_rsa` or `id_ed25519`. If they exist, you can skip the key generation step.

2. **Generate a New SSH Key (if needed)**

   If you don't have an SSH key, generate one:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   - Replace `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub email address.
   - When prompted, press Enter to save the key to the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).

3. **Add the SSH Key to Your SSH Agent**

   Start the SSH agent and add your key:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

4. **Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account**

   - Copy your public key:

     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```

   - Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to **Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key**.
   - Paste the copied key into the **Key** field, give it a title, and save.

5. **Test the SSH Connection**

   Test the connection to ensure everything is set up correctly:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   You should see a message like:

   ```
   Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```

##### Windows

1. **Check for Existing SSH Keys**

   Open **Git Bash** or **PowerShell** and run:

   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```

   Look for files like `id_rsa` or `id_ed25519`. If they exist, you can skip the key generation step.

2. **Generate a New SSH Key (if needed)**

   If you don't have an SSH key, generate one:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   - Replace `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub email address.
   - When prompted, press Enter to save the key to the default location (`C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\id_ed25519`).

3. **Add the SSH Key to Your SSH Agent**

   Start the SSH agent and add your key:

   ```powershell
   # Start the SSH agent service
   Start-Service ssh-agent

   # Set the SSH agent to start automatically with Windows
   Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic

   # Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent
   ssh-add ~\.ssh\id_ed25519
   ```

   *Note: Ensure you run PowerShell as an administrator to execute the above commands.*

4. **Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account**

   - Copy your public key:

     ```powershell
     Get-Content ~\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub
     ```

   - Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to **Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key**.
   - Paste the copied key into the **Key** field, give it a title, and save.

5. **Test the SSH Connection**

   Test the connection to ensure everything is set up correctly:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   You should see a message like:

   ```
   Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```

#### Step 1: Start SQL Server Using Docker Compose

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Ensure `docker-compose.yml` is Present**

   Verify that the `docker-compose.yml` file exists and contains the necessary configuration for SQL Server.

3. **Start the SQL Server Container**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Verify the Container is Running**

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   Ensure a container named `sqlserver` is listed and running.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Database and Start the API Server

Run the provided script to handle the following tasks automatically:

- Clone or update the repository using SSH.
- Drop the `LexiAuthenDB` database (if it exists).
- Delete the existing EF Core migrations.
- Create new EF Core migrations.
- Apply the migrations to set up the database schema.
- Build the backend API project.
- Start the API server.

##### macOS/Linux

1. **Make the Script Executable (Only Required Once)**

   ```bash
   chmod +x start-authen-api.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Script**

   ```bash
   ./start-authen-api.sh
   ```

##### Windows

1. **Run the Script**

   Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, navigate to the `backend` directory, and execute:

   ```cmd
   start-authen-api.bat
   ```

   *Alternatively, you can double-click the `start-authen-api.bat` file in File Explorer.*

Upon successful completion, the API server will be running in debug mode at:

- **HTTP**: `http://localhost:5108`
- **HTTPS**: `https://localhost:5001`

#### Step 3: Access the Swagger UI

The API server includes a **Swagger UI** for testing the available endpoints. You can access it by opening the following URL in your browser:

- **Swagger UI**: [https://localhost:5001/swagger](https://localhost:5001/swagger)

If you're running the server for the first time, your browser may show a security warning due to the self-signed SSL certificate. You can bypass this warning by proceeding to the site.

### Troubleshooting

1. **SSH Issues**:
   - Ensure your SSH key is correctly configured and added to your GitHub account.
   - Test the SSH connection with:

     ```bash
     ssh -T git@github.com
     ```

2. **Docker Container Not Running**:
   - Check that Docker is installed and running.
   - Use `docker logs sqlserver` to debug SQL Server container issues.

3. **SQLCMD Issues**:
   - Ensure the `sqlcmd` utility is installed and accessible in your `PATH`.
   - Verify SQL Server is running and accessible on port `1433`.

4. **EF Core Issues**:
   - If the database setup fails, ensure the SQL Server container is running.
   - Check the connection string in the script:

     ```bash
     Server=localhost;Database=LexiAuthenDB;User Id=sa;Password=YourNewStrong!Password;TrustServerCertificate=True;
     ```

5. **Script Permission Errors (macOS/Linux)**:
   - Ensure the script (`start-authen-api.sh`) has execute permissions:

     ```bash
     chmod +x start-authen-api.sh
     ```

6. **Script Execution Issues (Windows)**:
   - Ensure you are running the `.bat` file with sufficient privileges (e.g., as Administrator).
